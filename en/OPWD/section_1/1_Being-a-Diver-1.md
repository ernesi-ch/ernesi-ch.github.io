# Being a Diver 1

## Depth and Pressure

### Pressure and Air Volumne and Air Density
- sea level: 1 bar → pressure increases by 1bar every 10meters
- air volume gets compressed anti proportionally with pressure (i.e. deepness)
- air density change proportionally with pressure (i.e. deepness)

### Effects of Increasing Pressure on Body Air Spaces (Descending)
- the 3 major body air spaces are: (1) ears, (2) sinuses, (3) mask
- countereffect by **Equalization** (adding air to the air spaces) every few meters
	- equalize (1) ears and (2) sinuses by (a) blowing gently whilst holding nose, or (b) wiggeling jaws
	- equalize (3) mask by blwoing air into the mask from the nose
- lungs are equalized by continuous breathing

----------
### Effects of Decreasing Pressure on Body Air Spaces (Ascending)
- during ascending, the expanding air must exit our body → normally happens naturally in  (1) ears, (2) sinuses and (3) mask
- scuba supplies air at the surrounding pressure, your **lungs are at normal volume at depts** → when ascending, the air expands and its not a problem if you **continue breathing**

|:warning: breathe continuously and never, ever hold your breath|

|:warning: any time your regulator is not in your mouth, exhale a slow, steady bubble stream so you aren’t holding your breath.|

### Breathing Underwater
- Because scuba provides air at the surrounding pressure, as you go deeper each breath takes more air from your scuba cylinder. Therefore, the deeper you are, the faster you use your air.
- the deeper, the more effort and energy you spend if you breathe fast → take slow deep breaths

----------
### Buoyancy and Controlling Buoyancy
- Buoyancy (G: Auftrieb) → upward force in water
- salt water weighs more → it causes more buoyancy = more upward force.
- control buoyancy through
	- weight system
	- BCD (Buoncy Control Device)
	- inhaling / exhaling
- Buoyancy:
	-  decreases while descending (air volume decreases)
	-  increases while ascending (air expands)

### Buddy System
-   Plan your dives together.
-   Practicality: Help each other gear up and check each other’s equipment.
-   Safety: Remind each other of dive time and depth limits.
-   Safety: Assist each other if there’s a problem.
-   Assist each other with what each wants to do on the dive.
